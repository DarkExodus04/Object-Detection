<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This report is made for the purpose of Project 3 of the course EEL5934: Applied Machine learning systems.The project broadly comprises of two parts. The first part illustrates flower classification using a flowers dataset with 10 classes of flowers while the second demonstrates object detection for a dataset with vehicle images. According to the mentioned requirements, different neural network architecture are compared and the corresponding decisions and explanations are given.

## Files and Directories
- **Flower Classification Dataset**: Dataset for flower Classification.
- **Car Detection Dataset**: Dataset for Vehicle detection.
- **training.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook file where the data is explored, preprocessed and trained.
- **test.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook file for testing and evaliating performance on the test sets.
- **models**: Directory for storing trained models. The test file uses loads the models from this directory. Download Models from here.[[AML Project 3 Models](https://uflorida-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/n_noronha_ufl_edu/Ev2qGKZrXyJIsdaTv3y0kgMBWQmu8lIY3wWmabYp2S4wTw?e=c3iJBY)]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Dependencies
The project runs on Python Tensorflow 2.14 kernel on Hipergator.
Important Libraries required are as follows:

 - Scikit Learn
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Numpy
 - Tensorflow Keras
 
### Installation

1. Clone the repo in the Hipergator
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/UF-AppliedMLSystems-Fall23/project-3-NathanNoronha.git
   ```
2. Run training.ipynb file and let it save the models in the models directory.
3. Run test.ipynb file to test on the testing data set.
